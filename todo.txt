also need to create some way to update the context of the rows after its updated so that in the other views it also gets updated (do this with the context)
check if the rows are empty, if the rows are empty then have a create new protocol view, otherwise render what is being rendered now,
add a date and a phi number to the create new protocol button
commit

work on the backend , first install a migrations and population plug in,
create the protocol migration and then the applied view
populate it with some data
write tests
write a find oneByPhi and findByDate methods
write methods to find many by intervals of Phi and Date values

beautify
